                <h1>Personal Interests:</h1>
                <p class = "bodypara">
                    My interests span a diverse spectrum, reflecting both my love for the digital world and the great outdoors. 
                    In the field of programming, I find interest in unraveling the intricacies of software development, 
                    constantly seeking to refine my skills and explore new technologies. When I'm not immersed in code, 
                    I'll often be found hitting the trails, relishing the serenity of nature through hiking expeditions that offer both 
                    physical challenge and mental rejuvenation. In the winter months, I eagerly trade my hiking boots for ski gear, 
                    carving through the East-coast slopes in pursuit of adrenaline-fueled adventures. And when it's time to unwind, 
                    I indulge in the immersive worlds of the web, where I can lose myself in captivating narratives and engage in 
                    fantastical games with friends and foes alike. My interests weave together a tapestry of excitement, 
                    discovery, and growth, fueling my passion for exploration in both the virtual and real worlds.
                </p>
                <p class = "bodypara">
                    In recent times, my interests have even expanded into the physical nature of technology, 
                    where I've found a deep fascination in building computers and exploring the 
                    immersive potential of virtual reality. With meticulous attention to detail,
                     I've immersed myself in the process of assembling custom rigs, carefully selecting 
                     components to optimize performance and functionality. This not only satisfies
                      my technical curiosity but also deepens my understanding of hardware architecture 
                      and system optimization. Moreover, I've been captivated by the boundless possibilities
                       of VR, where one can transcend physical limitations and immerse themselves in captivating 
                       digital environments. Whether it's exploring distant planets, learning a 
                       new language, or simply unwinding in serene virtual landscapes, I've found that VR offers 
                       an unparalleled avenue for escapism and exploration. In embracing these technologies,
                        I find myself continuously pushing the boundaries of innovation while uncovering new dimensions of creativity and possibility.
