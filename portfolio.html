            <h1>Relational Database CLI:</h1>
            <p class = "bodypara">
                In this project, I worked on designing and implementing a relational database system based on a raw Spotify and Youtube statistics dataset for my Database Management Systems final project. 
                The implementation of the database system is done using PostgreSQL and the front-end Command-Line-Interface (CLI) is handled by a Python script.
                During the design process of this project, I identified use cases for the database system and developed an Entity-Relation Diagram (ERD) to represent the conceptual model of the database.
                Following this I created the tables using DDL commands and connected a Python script that handled queries including; "Insert Data","Delete Data","Update Data","Search Data","Aggregate Functions",
                "Sorting Queries","Join Queries","Grouping Queries","Subqueries", and Transactions.

                In this project, I worked on designing and programming a personal website featuring a Home page, Portfolio Page, and Contact Page for my Intro Web Design course final project.
                The implementation of this webpage was designed in HTML using CSS for stylization. During the design process of this project I created a wireframe design of each webpage using Microsoft Paint3D to give myself a rough outline for the final product.
                After creating an outline, I designed the webpage offline using Visual Studio Code.

            <p class = "bodypara">
                In this project, I was tasked with developing a college course scheduling software tailored to meet the needs of both educators and students for my Object Oriented Design course final project. This project was designed by leveraging the Apache Netbeans IDE with its integrated 
                Swing GUI editor. Using these I implemented the software using Java for the functionality and MySQL for the database handling, empowering teachers to effortlessly create semesters and classes with key details such as maximum student capacity and wait-list options.
                For students, the interface allows for easy enrollment in courses of their choice, managing available slots and transitioning student's enrollment into wait-list status when necessary. 
                Lastly the architecture of the system adheres to Object-Oriented design principles, ensuring clarity and efficiency through well-defined classes and specialized functionalities tailored to each user role and database entry type.
